# Trajectory-Dispersion

This code allows for the configuration of multiple simulation settings to be simulated on OpenRocket. This saves a lot of time in configuring the simulations, possibly creating thousands of simulations for many weather conditions, very easily. Every combination of settings are simulated and then the result is exported as a .csv file. The user must configure what and where is to be exported before the simulation takes place.

Current version is compatible with OpenRocket v15.03. The code has not been teste with OpenRocket v22, and may eventually be updated to work with it.

In order for the OpenRocket to recognize the listener, its path must be included in the classpath when running OpenRocket. This can be done in more than one way. For the installer version, you will find  "app/OpenRocket.cfg" in the installation directory of OpenRocket.

This program was developed in service for the Capital Rocket Team, it is made available for anyone to use, study, and extend as they will. Please, reference the team, or me, when using this software.
